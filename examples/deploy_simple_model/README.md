# Deploy a sentiment-analysis API in a few lines of code

This example illustrates how to use BudgetML to launch an API endpoint that runs on a preemtible Google Cloud Platform VM. 

The endpoint gets issued a SSL certificate via [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). 
The server automatically spins back up again whenever GCP shuts down the instance. The endpoint is a full fledged [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 
server, complete with interactive [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/) docs.

This particular example uses the awesome [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) library to deploy a simple sentiment analysis 
model based on BERT. It uses the [HuggingFace pipeline](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html) convenience 
function to achieve this.

Here is how you can try it for yourself.

## Set up
Create a Google Cloud Project, and follow the pre-requisite steps:

* Enable billing.
* Enable the following APIs:
  * test
  * test
* Create a service account with the following permissions (to be pointed at later with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS):
  * test
  * test

## Export env variables
```bash
export DOMAIN='DOMAIN'
export SUBDOMAIN='SUBDOMAIN' 
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
export GCP_PROJECT='GCP_PROJECT'
export GCP_MACHINE_TYPE='GCP_MACHINE_TYPE'  # change to whatever machine type you like
```

## Create a static IP (if not already created)
```python
python create_ip.py
```

This will create and print a static IP address on the terminal. Set this in the environment

```bash
export IP_ADDRESS='IP_ADDRESS' # change to static IP generated from `create_ip.py`
```

## Create the appropriate A record
In order to issue the SSL certificate via [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), there is a requirement to specify an 
A record that binds the static IP address to the subdomain and domain provided. This is simple in most popular domain 
providers. Here are guides for [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/how-to-change-dns-zones-mx-cname-and-a-records), 
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/319/2237/how-can-i-set-up-an-a-address-record-for-my-domain/) 
and [GoDaddy](godaddy.com/help/add-an-a-record-19238). These are the values to be set:

```bash
NAME=$SUBDOMAIN.$DOMAIN (e.g. model.mywebsite.com)
Value:$IP_ADDRESS (e.g. 35.137.10.45)
```

This might take a few minutes or even hours to propogate so good to pause here for a bit (or try the local deploy while we wait).

## Deploy locally (optional)
It is often a good idea to deploy locally to make sure that the `Predictor` class is created properly. 

Note that a Docker installation is required for this.

```python
python deploy_local.py
```

This will pull the base API image, add your requirements (if any), and create a local container with the same 
logic as the main `launch` function does. After its completed, a `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` will be completed, and 
the API will be accessible at `0.0.0.0:8000/docs`.

## Deploy to endpoint
Once tested locally, you are ready to deploy to the cloud. Use:

```python
python deploy.py
```

There will a lot of output, but at the end a `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` should show up (to be used in the next step). Here is 
what happened:

* A Google Cloud Bucket is created in GCP_PROJECT, where the `Predictor` class is uploaded.
* A (preemtible) is launched with a startup script that runs the [docker-swag](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) image 
  and a custom API image based on the base budgetml image on startup.
* A Cloud Scheduler function is initiated that always starts the server after every minute, to ensure minimum downtime.

The above three combined ensures the cheapest possible API endpoint with the lowest possible downtime.

## Interact with API
Navigating to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs` (after `deploy_local.py`) or `https://$SUBDOMAIN.$DOMAIN/docs` (after `deploy.py`)
will show a Swagger Docs page generated by FastAPI. To login, press the lock icon 
and enter the `username` and `password` generated above. Then you can play with the `predict_dict/` endpoint by 
making a POST request with the following json body:

```json
{
  "payload": {"text": "BudgetML is so awesome. I love it!"}
}
```

and the response should be something like:

```json
{
  "label": "POSITIVE",
  "score": 0.999879777431488
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use `curl`. First, get the token by using your `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` generated above.

```bash
curl -X POST "ENDPOINT/token" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "grant_type=&username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD&scope=&client_id=&client_secret="
```

Then use the token generated from the above command to hit the API.

```bash
curl -X POST "ENDPOINT:8000/predict_dict/" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"payload\":{\"text\":\"BudgetML is so awesome. I love it!\"}}"
```

Again, endpoint will be `http://0.0.0.0:8000` for local and `https://$SUBDOMAIN.$DOMAIN` for actual deployment.
